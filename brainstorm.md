# Applictions I would Like to Develop:
- 1) Continue my custom study and triva application from project 3
	- Liked much of UI from that application
	- Can add many other resources related from the topic
	- Change question source from local to cloud based
	- Keep a user profile section for their hightest score
	- # Market : Education
	- # Mobile : APplication is pprtable and personalized, could have reminders (notifications on why to come back and study)
	- # Story & Market : Pratical for students across US high schools and colleges.
	# Scope : Applicattion can be built in mutiple steps as features can be added gradually.  Many features are independent of each other so can app can be useful in limited scope
- 2) Application that allows people to discover new video games and purchase thrm in at the best price
	- Have a section on where user can search for games they liked
	- Can make a user profile section where user can store there favorite games and categories
	- Use user profiles to make reccomendations on similar
	- Uses CheapShark API
	# Makret : Entertaiment 
	# Mobile : Personalized , notification when new deals come out
	# Story & Market : Any person (but more releastically primally teenages and anyone that enjoys video games )
	# Scope : Can implement features gradually, can intially start with just search, then add user profuile for saved games, algo for user reccomendations may be more advanced.
- 3) Application that allows people to explore landmarks and cities around the world.
	- Great travel companion 
	- Can provide useful information about various fun locations 
	- Allows people to explore new places that they may have not considered visiting
	- Uses the GEODB CIties API for information and flicker API for images
	# Makret : Travel
	# Mobile : Can collect users location to provide nearby attractions, user profile section
	# Story & Market : Pratically anyone but espically useful for the adventrous and those who travel to different cities and countries often
	# Scope : Application can be implemented in phases, scale of application is small yet still useful
- 4) Sleep tracking and guidance application :
	Adults, but students in particular often get less than the reccomended sleep, This app will aim to allow users to log their daily sleep amount ( could also use the built in health data ) and make recomendations based on user profile
- 5) Student to Student tutor finder
	Each student has their strength and weaknesses and often they learn the best from their peers.  This app can be a social platform for students to discover other students that are good and willing to tutor subjects they personally are struggling or need help with.
- 6) Intro to Coding Application : 
	There are many websites online that teach young indivoduals how to code but many of these do not have a mobile equvilance.  Coding can be a great skill to have in the 21st century so being able to learn anywhere is a great advantage 

# Descion :  
- After consulting all my options I belive that the trvael application provides a nice baalnce and functionality use of ideas we have learned throughout this course and something that can realistically be coded within our two week window.  Additionally it has a wide reach as anyone could enjoy traveling and exploring and it could even be useful for myself and friends.
